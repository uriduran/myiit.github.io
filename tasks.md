#Task Analysis
*The goal of this project is to redesign the webpage where the user is able to update personal information (such as emergency
contacts, name changes, address changes, etc.) Currently the important information and where to input new information is spread around
in various pages. The goal is to bring them all together into a single page in a manner that is simple and fluid.

**Below are the current steps required to reach (one of the pages) that allows you to change/add personal information.**
 
1. **STEP:** 

    User logs in via my.iit.edu website and is greeted with the welcome page:
    
    *Welcome page![Welcome](images/welcome-page.png)
2. **STEP:**
    
    User must then find tucked in the corner a menu labeled "Banner Self-Service.
    
    The user is presented with an overwhelming amount of options that they have to swift through
    in order to find something as simple as viewing their emergency contacts.

3. **STEP:**

    Once the user decides what page they wish to visit they are presented with this.
    For this example we selected the page to update/add phone numbers.
    We believe that the layout is both uninviting and too small (the whole point of this page is to add phone numbers
    and the place where you can do that takes about 10% of the page.)
