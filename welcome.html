			<h2>Welcome new students</h2>
			<h4>Welcome to the IIT portal for all Newly Admitted Students.</h4>
			
			<p>As a student at IIT, your myIIT account will be your primary vehicle to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>register for class</li>
				<li>check on your financial aid and other resources</li>
				<li>view your bill, make payments and manage your student account</li>
				<li>check your email</li>
				<li>review classroom assignments on Blackboard</li>
				<li>learn about forthcoming lectures, student events, and volunteer activities</li>
				<li>plan your study abroad</li>
				<li>explore hundreds of course offerings</li>
				<li>chat with fellow students about the progress of their IPRO</li>
				<li>and much more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Explore the site. Greater functionality is added to your account once you formally enroll at the university but for now we can think of better introduction to the university than to immerse yourself in the life of the university.</p>
